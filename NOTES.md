An ATM has banknotes of nominal values 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dollars. You can consider that there is a large enough supply of each of these banknotes.

You have to write the ATM's function that determines the minimal number of banknotes needed to honor a withdrawal of n dollars, with 1 <= n <= 1500.

Return that number, or -1 if it is impossible.

Good Luck!!!

# POMODORO 1
✅ - Test if numbers are positive values
  ✅ - Write unit test. Input: 10. Output: true
  ✅ - Write unit test. Input: 0. Output: false
  ✅ - Write unit test. Input: -20. Output: false
✅ - Write function to implement the logic

# POMODORO 2
- Test if the right number of nominal values will be withdrawned that equals or are below 1500. Example: 500 dollars. return 3 because it is exactly 1500
  - Write unit test. Input: 500. Output: 3
- Write function to implement the logic
